# Bioinformatics 576: Add Salmon
This project is a dual-branch RNA-Seq analysis pipeline. It is a modular, command-line based suite of scriptts designed to process raw RNA-sequencing data. It will offer pre-processing and QC of provided FASTQ files. The QC'd FASTQs can be fed in to either of two parralel analysis pathways within a single ecosystem. The **Standard Pipeline** will offer a robust standard approach involving genome alignment (`HISAT2` or `STAR`), BAM processing, and feature counting. The **Add Salmon Pipeline** will offer lightweight quasi-mapping using `Salmon` for rapid transcript quantification and isoform-level analysis. Both pipelines will converge in to `DESeq2` for statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes. Finally, visualization of the data will be provided via heatmaps and volcano plots for gene expression and differentially expressed genes, and bar and heatmap plots for isoform switching and usage.
